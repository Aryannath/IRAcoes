First of all, thank you very much to come here and want to give some help in this project.

The IRacoes project is an open source project, who aims to provide simple tools to make tax payment easy to all.

In Brazil people who trade in Stock Market have to pay a tax of 15% or 20% to the government, so the idea is to make this calculation easy.

The code is in Ruby and the major file is **acoes.rb** all the other files need to be in another directory or branch I am going to to that.

The **acoes.rb** file is a monolithic application without any integration with a data bank, written in a structured form.



We have some task to make this project with **YOUR** help.

Here are some issues that we are going to do.

1- Do the math calculation

- [ ] Date manipulation
- [ ] tax calculation
- [ ] stocks in and out from the wallet
- [ ] another feature that might be necessary but I do not remember now.

2- Make the website

- [ ] JavaScript in front end with async functions
- [ ] JavaScript in back end using nodejs
- [ ] integration with mysql or sqlite data bank
- [ ] KISS method specially in CSS files
- [ ] responsive HTML 

3- Make the integration to the data bank

- [ ] MySQL or SQLite files
- [ ] ruby and node integration
- [ ] tables must have stock data, user name and passwords for multiple guests

4- Put the website to run in Heroku (I am going to do that in the last week of October)

5- Create a tutorial 

- [ ] Make a tutorial in Portuguese with pictures, necessary to use the wiki part in github
- [ ] Make a tutorial in English with pictures, necessary to use the wiki part in github

6- Test the program

We need a lot of testing in all functions so it should be very good to write testing program

Do some testing as a I single user and comment the pros and worst parts three of a kind, you need to be a newbie to do data



For first timers and to help and learn more about ruby, try first to test the program and find some bugs.

The all first timers must contribute writing down this mini biopic
